Before running the Uforia program, you need to change some settings.

Edit the settings for the main program (like multithreading, starting directory and database) in:
    ./Uforia/source/include/config.py
    
Before developing for/on Uforia, please read the documents and tutorials in:
    ./Uforia/docs/

The current branches are heavily in flux, as we are in the process of developing and pushing the first set of modules at the moment.

We therefore strongly recommend running the master branch if you intend to test Uforia right now.
